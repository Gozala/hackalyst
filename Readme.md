## Facts

1. If you're into technology (very likely, since you're reading this on
github :) you're constantly trying / should be trying to unlock new skills!!

2. It's a lot easier to learn a thing if someone with an experience can spend
some time with you to help you through the first few steps.

3. We are all awesome and each one of us knows thing or two better than others,
that still plan to dig in.

## Idea

Given the facts above, we could catalyze skill unlock process by collaborating
and exchanging experiences with each other. For example [@gozala][] wants to
learn about [WEBRTC][], so he submits a ticket [#1](./hackalyst/issues/1)
telling local community about he's intent! It turns out that [@antonkovalyov][]
and [@gordonbrander][] would also like to learn about it, so they express their
interest via :+1: comment. By coincidence [@raynos][] has being hacking on
[WEBRTC][] for a last few month and would love to share his experience to a
fellow hackers to get them up to speed! [@raynos][] also happens to be
interested in [arrows][], so he submits a ticket... Hopefully by now you got
the idea, if not submit a ticket :D

Maybe you want to share your knowledge with the community? [Submit][] a ticket
too!!

## Implementation

This is an attempt to implement this ambitious idea by building community of
people that wish to exchanging knowledge. So if you'd like to learn thing or
two [submit][] tickets, also feel free to mention someone who may know or
would be interested in learning, to find a pioneer and generate a momentum!

## F.A.Q.

- Q: What if I don't have a github account ?  
  A: Go and get one, seriously there is no reason not to!


- Q: Where will this sessions be held ?   
  A: I'll try to organize those in San Francisco, hopefully [@mozilla][] and
  maybe others will occasionally host the sessions.


- Q: I love the idea, but I'm not in San Francisco ?  
  A: Fork the repo and implement idea in your city, or maybe do via video
  conferencing.

- Q: What is the format of sessions ?  
  A: Have no idea. We'll learn what works best during the process. Maybe
     it should be session specific and be decided in the ticket itself.
